SPD Capstone Project:
Full Stack Development - "Community Exchange Hub"
Objective:
Develop a web application called "Community Exchange Hub" that allows local communities to exchange goods,
services, and knowledge. The goal is to promote sustainable living, encourage local trade, and build stronger
community bonds.
Project Requirements:
1. Backend Development:
 Database Design & Management:
 User profiles (name, email, password, profile image, and location).
 Products/services listings (title, description, images, category, date posted).
 Message system for users to communicate.
 Reviews and ratings for users.
 Server-side logic:
 User registration, login, and authentication.
 CRUD operations for product/service listings.
 Search functionality based on product/service category, keywords, and location.
 Messaging system backend operations.
 Logic for ratings and reviews.
2. Frontend Development:
 Responsive Web Design:
 Homepage showcasing recent listings and top-rated users.
 User dashboard to manage their listings, messages, and reviews.
 Listing details page.
 User profile view and edit page.
 Messaging interface.
 Interactivity:
 Form validation and feedback.
3. Deployment & DevOps: (Optional)
 Choose a suitable cloud provider for hosting (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).
4. Documentation:
 Database schemas and ER diagrams.
 API documentation (if used).
 User manual/guide.
5. Security and other user input Considerations:
 Data validation and protection against SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, etc.
 Can the user input special characters (i.e. ;, ‘, “, ...) and break the system? Application should
protect itself from users entering “bad” data.
6. Local copy of website using VS Code or other IDE
 The final website should be runnable locally in a virtual environment with a requirements.txt file.
 CS50 Users - NOTE: DO NOT try to create a virtual environment on CS50. One was created for you
by GitHub, and you are already using a virtual environment on CS50. When you website is
complete, you will need to download the website and then create a local virtual environment for your
website.
Tools & Technologies (Suggested):
 Backend: Python Flask.
 Database: SQLite
